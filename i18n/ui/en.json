  "app.mainmenu.welcome.content": "NSFW Dice Game is a playful and exciting dice game designed to bring fun, curiosity, and intimacy back to life. You can play it with your partner or with friends for an evening full of humor, excitement, and surprises. The game starts light and funny, gradually builds toward more sensual and cheeky challenges, and depending on the selected categories, may lead to real sexual interaction. By rolling the dice, you earn points, but if you lose a round, a task awaits that takes the atmosphere to the next level. No game ever plays out the same way; chance decides how far things go.",
